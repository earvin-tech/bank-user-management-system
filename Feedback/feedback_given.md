    Feedback on comments:
    Comments are very detailed explaining the purpose of each function. Each function has comments describing the purpose, parameters, and returned data, this makes it easy for other developers to understand what the code is doing. Comments made describing individual lines of code are just as descriptive which is good. Can not find anything that would need improvement or change as the comments cover all the code sufficiently.

    README file:

    Explaining Setup and dependencies:

    Explanations of how to setup the application seem to be very detailed, showing step-by-step how to access the application from GitHub and onto the user's local machine. Documentation also goes further to provide links to official documentation to assist in accessing the app with Python.

    Also listed are all external libraries such as colored or built-in modules such as JSON. Documentation on set-up seem to be covered very well.

    Purpose of Application:

    The explanation of the application to users seems quite brief, especially for people who are not familiar with Dungeons and Dragons. However users may be able to get more of an idea of the app by following the steps and running it. Perhaps it would be more understandable to explain the different dice rolls or even the flow of the game.

    Features of Application:

    The documentation does well to explain the individual functions within the app. It adds more detail about the general purpose of the app which is needed. Listing future functions to implement is very helpful for other developers.

Feedback Provided

Strengths:
Well-structured Table of Contents and clear navigation.
Installation steps and dependency details are comprehensive.
Ethical considerations regarding licenses are well-documented.
Code in main.py is functional, with meaningful outputs and well-written docstrings.

Improvement Areas

ReadMe:
Add visual aids (e.g., screenshots or diagrams).
main.py:
Add inline comments for complex logic
Clarify variable names for better readability.
requirements.txt:
Differentiate essential vs. optional dependencies.

Ethical Concern: * Privacy of Conversion History: The application saves user conversion history locally. If not properly secured, this data could expose sensitive financial information.
